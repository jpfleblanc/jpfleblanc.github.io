abstract = {We present libami, a lightweight implementation of algorithmic Matsubara integration (AMI) written in C++. AMI is a tool for analytically resolving the sequence of nested Matsubara integrals that arise in virtually all Feynman perturbative expansions.
Program summary
Program Title: libami CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/zkwwmbnm6m.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/jpfleblanc/libami Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: C++ Nature of problem: Perturbative expansions in condensed matter systems are formulated on the imaginary frequency/time axis and are often represented as a series of Feynman diagrams, which involve a sequence of nested integrals/summations over internal Matsubara indices as well as other internal variables. Solution method: libami provides a minimal framework to symbolically generate and store the analytic solution to the temporal Matsubara sums through repeated application of multipole residue theorems. The solution can be applied to any frequency-independent interaction expansion. Once generated, the analytic solution is valid in any dimensionality with any dispersion at arbitrary temperature. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: Requires C++11 standard. Optional compilation with boost-multiprecision library.
