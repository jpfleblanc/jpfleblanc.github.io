  abstract={Precise calculations of dynamics in the homogeneous electron gas (jellium model) are of fundamental importance for design and characterization of new materials. We introduce a diagrammatic Monte Carlo technique based on algorithmic Matsubara integration that allows us to compute frequency and momentum resolved finite temperature response directly in the real frequency domain using a series of connected Feynman diagrams. The data for charge response at moderate electron density are used to extract the frequency dependence of the exchange-correlation kernel at finite momenta and temperature. These results are as important for development of the time-dependent density functional theory for materials dynamics as ground state energies are for the density functional theory.}

Program summary
Program Title: libami CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/zkwwmbnm6m.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/jpfleblanc/libami Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: C++ Nature of problem: Perturbative expansions in condensed matter systems are formulated on the imaginary frequency/time axis and are often represented as a series of Feynman diagrams, which involve a sequence of nested integrals/summations over internal Matsubara indices as well as other internal variables. Solution method: libami provides a minimal framework to symbolically generate and store the analytic solution to the temporal Matsubara sums through repeated application of multipole residue theorems. The solution can be applied to any frequency-independent interaction expansion. Once generated, the analytic solution is valid in any dimensionality with any dispersion at arbitrary temperature. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: Requires C++11 standard. Optional compilation with boost-multiprecision library.

  abstract={The Hubbard model represents the fundamental model for interacting quantum systems and electronic correlations. Using the two-dimensional half-filled Hubbard model at weak coupling as a testing ground, we perform a comparative study of a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art quantum many-body methods. Upon cooling into its insulating antiferromagnetic ground state, the model hosts a rich sequence of distinct physical regimes with crossovers between a high-temperature incoherent regime, an intermediate-temperature metallic regime, and a low-temperature insulating regime with a pseudogap created by antiferromagnetic fluctuations. We assess the ability of each method to properly address these physical regimes and crossovers through the computation of several observables probing both quasiparticle properties and magnetic correlations, with two numerically exact methods (diagrammatic and determinantal quantum Monte Carlo methods) serving as a benchmark. By combining computational results and analytical insights, we elucidate the nature and role of spin fluctuations in each of these regimes. Based on this analysis, we explain how quasiparticles can coexist with increasingly long-range antiferromagnetic correlations and why dynamical mean-field theory is found to provide a remarkably accurate approximation of local quantities in the metallic regime. We also critically discuss whether imaginary-time methods are able to capture the non-Fermi-liquid singularities of this fully nested system.}

  abstract={We demonstrate how to identify which physical processes dominate the low-energy spectral functions of correlated electron systems. We obtain an unambiguous classification through an analysis of the equation of motion for the electron self-energy in its charge, spin, and particle-particle representations. Our procedure is then employed to clarify the controversial physics responsible for the appearance of the pseudogap in correlated systems. We illustrate our method by examining the attractive and repulsive Hubbard model in two dimensions. In the latter, spin fluctuations are identified as the origin of the pseudogap, and we also explain why ùëë-wave pairing fluctuations play a marginal role in suppressing the low-energy spectral weight, independent of their actual strength.}

  abstract={Numerical results for ground-state and excited-state properties (energies, double occupancies, and Matsubara-axis self-energies) of the single-orbital Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square lattice are presented, in order to provide an assessment of our ability to compute accurate results in the thermodynamic limit. Many methods are employed, including auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo, bare and bold-line diagrammatic Monte Carlo, method of dual fermions, density matrix embedding theory, density matrix renormalization group, dynamical cluster approximation, diffusion Monte Carlo within a fixed-node approximation, unrestricted coupled cluster theory, and multireference projected Hartree-Fock methods. Comparison of results obtained by different methods allows for the identification of uncertainties and systematic errors. The importance of extrapolation to converged thermodynamic-limit values is emphasized. Cases where agreement between different methods is obtained establish benchmark results that may be useful in the validation of new approaches and the improvement of existing methods.}
